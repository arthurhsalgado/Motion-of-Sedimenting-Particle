# Motion-of-Sedimenting-Particle

## Introduction

This project is being used for the purpose of enhancing abilities toward the use of numerical methods applied in the context of physical problems that are described by differential equations.

## Dynamic of Sedimenting Particle

### Linear Analysis 

The dynamics of a sedimenting particle will be studied by applying a free body diagram to the particle, that will be to understand the force that are acting in the movement of the particle, as described in the image below:
